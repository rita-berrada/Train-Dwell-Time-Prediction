# üöÜ Train Dwell Time Prediction

## üìç Context & Motivation
India‚Äôs public transport system is vast, vital, and‚Ä¶ deeply flawed. From overcrowded stations to unpredictable delays, the railways suffer from poor infrastructure, inconsistent management, and a lack of real-time planning tools. Train delays are not just an inconvenience ‚Äî they are part of daily life, often leading to missed connections, lost goods, and collective frustration.

In this context, improving the **prediction of dwell time** (the time a train spends at a station) becomes a powerful lever to enhance efficiency and reduce chaos. This project was initiated in collaboration with an Indian railway company aiming to **predict train dwell times more accurately using AI models**.

---

## üéØ Objective
We focus on a particular set of trains and aim to model their **dwell time at the station "MINOT"**, which we define as the **last true change point** for all trains in the dataset.

> üîé **Dwell Time** = `Departure Time at MINOT` ‚Äì `Arrival Time at MINOT`

## üìö Notebooks Overview

This project is structured in 4 main notebooks:

---

### `01_EDA_Dwell_Time_Data.ipynb`
We explore the raw dwell time dataset using a classic EDA workflow:
- Distribution plots
- Categorical feature exploration
- Missing value handling
- Basic cleaning and formatting

---

### `02_Outlier_Detection_and_Removal.ipynb`
Outlier detection is essential to avoid skewed predictions.

- **First attempt**: IQR-based filtering ‚Üí ‚ùå Ineffective due to skewed distribution.  
- **Second attempt**: Custom binning strategy ‚Üí ‚úîÔ∏è More robust.

**Steps:**
1. Train/test split based on arrival date (training = before Jan 1, 2024)  
2. Binning dwell times and keeping only bins with ‚â• 5% of trains  
3. Computing lower/upper bounds and adding `IS_OUTLIER` flag

---

### `03_Preprocessing_Supplementary_Tables.ipynb`
Preparation of the **Events** (planned movements) and **Schedule** (actual movements) tables:
- Cleaned both datasets
- Found common `TRAIN_ID`s and arrival times
- Merged into one dataset
- Extracted relevant structured columns
- Produced a feature-ready table

---

### `04_Feature_Engineering_and_Correlation.ipynb`
In this notebook we:
- Created **14 features**
- Plotted distribution graphs for each
- Studied feature correlation
- Performed a linear regression as a first modeling attempt

## üìä Feature-by-Feature Insights (with Figures)

### Inspection Requirement
Indicates whether a train needs to be inspected once it arrives at a station.  
Various reasons: technical checks, routine maintenance, etc.  
Binary flag:  
- **Y** = Inspection is required  
- **N** = No inspection needed  

![Inspection Requirement](figs/Inspection_Requirement.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time is higher when inspection is required.

---

### Is Holiday
Indicates whether the train arrived on a national holiday in the United States.  
Binary flag:  
- **1** = Arrived on a holiday  
- **0** = Did not arrive on a holiday  

![IS_HOLIDAY](figs/IS_HOLIDAY.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time is lower on holidays ‚Äî unexpected, as one might anticipate longer stops due to reduced staffing or special operations.

---

### Train Priority
Each train is assigned a priority flag that indicates its operational importance.  

![Train Priority](figs/Train_Priority.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time varies with priority, with priorities H and M showing similar patterns.

---

### Mainline
If the train is on track 6398 or 6399, it is considered **Mainline**.  
Binary flag:  
- **1** = On mainline  
- **0** = Not on mainline  

![Mainline Trains](figs/MainlineTrains.png)  
**Insight:** No significant variation in dwell time between mainline and non-mainline trains.

---

### Day of Week
Indicates on which day of the week the train arrived.  

![Day of Week](figs/Day_of_Week.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell times increase from mid-week to weekend ‚Äî lowest on Wednesday, highest on Saturday.

---

### Day Type
Indicates whether the arrival day of trains is a weekday or weekend.  
Binary flag:  
- **1** = Weekend  
- **0** = Weekday  

![Day Type](figs/Day_Type.png)  
**Insight:** No significant variation between weekdays and weekends.

---

### Month
Indicates the month of arrival of trains.  

![Month](figs/Month.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time varies significantly by month ‚Äî higher in June, February, and December; lower in May and September.

---

### Hour of Day
Indicates the hour of the day when trains reach the station.  

![Hour of Day](figs/Hour_of_Day.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time varies across the day, with a peak at 1 pm.

---

### All Trains
Number of other trains present on the track at the same time as the train being analyzed (Train A).  
Counts all trains that:  
- Arrived before Train A and departed after its arrival, **or**  
- Arrived after Train A but haven‚Äôt departed yet.  

![All Trains](figs/AllTrains.png)  
**Insight:** Some variation in dwell time as the number of trains increases.

---

### Yard Trains
Subset of "All Trains" that require inspection and cannot stay on the main track.  
These trains are moved to the yard and counted as **YardTrains**.  

![Yard Trains](figs/YardTrains.png)  
**Insight:** Fluctuations in dwell time with the count of yard trains.

---

### Mainline Trains
Subset of "All Trains" that don‚Äôt require inspection and stay on the mainline.  

![Mainline Trains](figs/MainlineTrains.png)  
**Insight:** The more mainline trains present, the higher the dwell time.

---

### Priority Trains
Trains from "All Trains" set that are considered high priority.  
High priority trains include: A, B, G, S, H, Q, Z, V.  

![Priority Trains](figs/PriorityTrains.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time varies with different numbers of priority trains.

---

### Priority Yard
Priority trains that are also yard trains.  

![Priority Yard](figs/PriorityYard.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time increases as the number of priority yard trains rises.

---

### Priority Mainline
Priority trains that are also mainline trains.  

![Priority Mainline](figs/PriorityMainline.png)  
**Insight:** Dwell time rises with the number of priority mainline trains.

---

### Feature Correlation
Correlation analysis between all engineered features.
